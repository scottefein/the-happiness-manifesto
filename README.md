You can view the original blog post here: http://blog.sefindustries.com/the-happiness-manifesto/

Herein lies the values we, as Happiness Driven Developers (HDD), hold to be true. Because who doesn't want to be happy?

*As a happiness driven developer...*

    - We value languages that are optimized for developers over the computer
    - We value agile development over waterfall development
    - We value open-source frameworks and tools over tools controlled by a single organization
    - We value strong test coverage for our code for both maintainability and documentation over untested codebases
    - We value curiosity and exploration over adherence to standard
    - We value maintainable code, emphasizing clarity over cleverness
    - We value openness, sharing, and collaboration over credentials and barriers
    - We value an environment conducive to all levels of experience, over exclusivity and elitism
    - We value respect, understanding, and tolerance towards all in my community, over pure meritocracy
    - We value and welcome new ideas and new ways of solving problems over "how we've always done things"
