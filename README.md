Herein lies the values we, as Happiness Driven Developers (HDD), hold to be true. Because who doesn't want to be happy?

*As a happiness driven developer...*

    - We value readable, maintainable code over runtime performance.
    - We value open-source infrastructure and tools over tools controlled by a single organization.
    - We value curiosity and exploration over adherance to standards.
    - We value openness, sharing, and collaboration over credentials and barriers.
    - We value an environment conducive to all levels of experience, over exclusivity and elitism.
    - We value software development as a craft, not just a profession.
    - We value respect and tolerance to all, over pure meritocracy
