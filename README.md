# The Happiness Manifesto
### Happiness Driven Development

*As a happiness driven developerâ€¦*

- I value languages that are optimized for developers over the computer
- I value agile development over waterfall development
- I value open-source frameworks and tools over tools controlled by a single organization
- I value strong test coverage for our code for both maintainability and documentation over untested codebases
- I value curiosity and exploration over adherence to standard
- I value maintainable code, emphasizing clarity over cleverness
- I value openness, sharing, and collaboration over credentials and barriers
- I value an environment conducive to all levels of experience, over exclusivity and elitism
- I value respect, understanding, and tolerance towards all in my community, over pure meritocracy
- I value and welcome new ideas and new ways of solving problems over "how we've always done things"
